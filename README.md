## Git concepts
* Repository: Project space where files and history of the development are stored
* Working copy: Repository files at your local machine
* Branch: a development path, linked to the repository
* Commit: Picture of the repository files at a given moment
* Checkout: Change your working copy to a given commit or branch
* Push/Pull: Upload/Download to/from repository
* Merge: Incorporate a set of commits of branch A to branch B
* Issue: A problem, bug, new feature, we want/have to work with
* Merge/Pull Request: Request of merging a branch/commit to another branch
* Fork: Unlinked development path, which creates an independent repository
